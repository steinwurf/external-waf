import sys

# This file is the "entry point" for all our extensions to Waf. The main
# purpose is to import the custom contexts used. When a context is
# imported it auto registers with Waf and overrides any contexts that were
# previously defined for a specific command.

from waflib import Errors

# A general note on the Context. Waf uses a meta-classes registration
# system for the Context classes. This means that to register e.g. a new
# ConfigurationContext it is enough to simply import the module where the
# context class is defined. When the Python interpreter sees the definition
# waf will auto-register that this should be the new
# ConfigurationContext. Below we will import a number of modules containing
# our custom contexts.
#
# The options context is instantiated automatically every time waf is
# invoked.
#
# It will recurse out in the options(...) functions defined in the
# wscript. We have customized it to launch the waf_resolve_context which
# first recurses the resolve(...) functions to fetch any defined
# dependencies.
from . import waf_resolve_context
from . import waf_options_context
from . import waf_configuration_context

# We add a number of methods to the ConfigurationContext and BuildContext
# objects used in Waf's configure(...) and build(...) functions (found in
# most wscripts). To register these functions we just need to import the module
# where they are defined:
from . import waf_conf

# Check Python support for system locale
from . import compat
