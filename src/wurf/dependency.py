class Dependency(object):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        """Construct an instance.

        A small object to store information about a dependency.

        Small example (from a dictionary):

            info = {'name': 'foo',
                    'recurse': True,
                    'optional': False,
                    'resolver': 'git',
                    'method': 'checkout',
                    'checkout': '1.3.3.7',
                    'source': 'github.com/acme-corp/foo.git'}

            # Expand the dict as keyword arguments
            dependency = Dependency(**info)

            # Now we can access the keys as attributes
            assert dependency.name == 'foo'
            assert dependency.recurse == True

        The 'sha1' extra attribute is added to the dependency, which is
        a hash value of all the dependency information. This allows
        us to e.g. easily compare whether two dependencies with the same name
        are equal or whether one has some different options.

        Continuing the example from above, this value can be queried using the
        sha1 attribute:

            # Access the sha1 attribute
            print(f"Dependency hash {dependency.sha1}")

        Additional attributes may be added to the dependency during resolve.
        However, they cannot overwrite the existing attributes created at
        construction time.

        So in the small example from before all the following attributes are
        not directly modifiable: name, recurse, optional, resolver, method,
        checkout, source and sha1. If these attributes needs to be modifid
        e.g. to "customize" the way resolvers are constructed, this can be done
        using the rewrite(...) function.

        Note on rewrite(...) and SHA1: One obvious question to raise is whether
        we should re-calculate the SHA1 after a rewrite. We currently do not do
        this. Reason for this is that the SHA1 is mainly used to check if the
        user provided information, has been changed. If this happens the SHA1
        will flag a mismatch, and the user should do a reconfigure to continue.
        The fact that we rewrite(...) the dependency information e.g. to use
        a user-defined git checkout does not change this.
        In fact after having resolved the dependency we do not really care how
        we got there.

        Any other attributes can be added and modified as needed. The following
        documents used attributes with reserved meaning:

        - "is_symlink" and "real_path": The "is_symlink" attribute denotes
          whether the path returned by the resolver is a symbolic link. If
          this is the case the "real_path" attribute of the dependency will
          contain the path in the file-system which the symbolic link points
          to.

        - "resolver_chain": This attribute assigns a high-level name to the
          chain of resolvers, such as "Resolve" or "Load". This describes
          the high-level operation of the resolver chain.

        - "resolver_action": The "resolver_action" this attribute describes the
          specific action taken to resolve the dependency. For example:
          "git checkout", "user path" etc.

        - "git_tag": This attribute is specified if the dependency is
          resolved to a specific git tag.

        - "git_commit" If specified this attribute contains a specific git
          commit id (SHA1) where the dependency has been resolved.

        # avoid computing it over and over.
        #
        # A good question here, is why do we store both the sha1 and another
        # integer hash?
        #
        # The sha1 is stored in config files describing a dependency, so it

        #
        # However, we cannot rely only on the SHA1 as it is stored as a string
        # which means it cannot be returned from the __hash__ function (it
        # requires an integer). The simplest solution therefore seemed to be:
        #
        # 1. Use the stable / consistent SHA1 hash for describing a dependency
        #    in external formats such as files
        # 2. Use the Python hash() function to generate a integer hash for
        #    run-time usage (i.e. within the same interpreter session).
